import Foundation

/// Example 1:
///
/// Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
/// Output: "c"
/// Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
/// Example 2:
///
/// Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
/// Output: "f"
/// Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
/// Example 3:
///
/// Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
/// Output: "x"
/// Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
