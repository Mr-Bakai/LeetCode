/// Given an unsorted array of integers nums, 
/// return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
/// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
///
/// Example 1:
/// Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
/// Output: 4
/// Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
///
/// Example 2:
/// Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
/// Output: 9
///
/// Constraints:
/// 0 <= nums.length <= 105
/// -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
