Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of
nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]),
return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number 
to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could 
search circularly to find its next greater number.
If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
 
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
The number 2 can't find next greater number.
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, 
which is also 2.
 
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
